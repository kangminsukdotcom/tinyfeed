# tinyfeed Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

I, the maintainer of tinyfeed, care deeply about the security of the software I wrote. As such, this disclosure policy has been set up to facilitate external contribution on this topic.

**Guidelines**

We require that all security researchers:  
* Perform research only within the scope set out below;  
* Use the identified communication channels to report vulnerability information to us; and  
* Keep information about any vulnerabilities you’ve discovered confidential between yourself and the maintainer of this repository until we’ve had 30 days to resolve the issue.

If you follow these guidelines when reporting an issue to us, we commit to:  
- Not pursue or support any legal action related to your research;  
- Work with you to understand and resolve the issue quickly (including an initial confirmation of your report within 7 days of submission);  

**Scope**

- Any usage of tinyfeed that could put the user at risk.  
- The systems related to distributing tinyfeed.

**Out of scope**

Any services hosted by 3rd party providers and services are excluded from scope. These services include:  
- The demo (hosted on GitHub Pages)  
- Any public tinyfeed instance deployed by our users.

In the interest of the safety of our users, staff, the Internet at large and you as a security researcher, the following test types are excluded from scope:  
* Findings from physical testing such as office access (e.g. open doors, tailgating)  
* Findings derived primarily from social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing)  
* Findings from applications or systems not listed in the ‘Scope’ section  
* UI and UX bugs and spelling mistakes  
* Network level Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) vulnerabilities  

Things we do not want to receive:  
* Personally identifiable information (PII)  
* Credit card holder data  

**How to report a security vulnerability?**

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in one of our products or platforms please use GitHub’s built-in private security vulnerability reporting tool at [github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/tinyfeed](https://github.com/TheBigRoomXXL/tinyfeed/security)

Please include the following details with your report:  
* Description of the location and potential impact of the vulnerability;  
* A detailed description of the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability (POC scripts or repos, screenshots, and screen captures are all helpful to us);

We currently don't support PGP encryption.
